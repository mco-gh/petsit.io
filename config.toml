Our mission is to provide your dog with exercise, fresh air, and
the opportunity to socialise and play, while receiving the
attention and care that you yourself would give them. We take
groups of no more than 3 dogs per walker across many of North
London’s wonderful parks. Other dog walking services allow as
many as 6 dogs per walker (some even more!), which, we
believe, compromises their safety and the level of care they
receive. With us, your dog will not spend any walking time being
transported in the back of a van and you will always know
exactly who is taking care of him/her, because it will be me, with
the occasional help of another dog loving, caring and
experienced walker.

Hello, my name is Sally and I was born in the Peak District and my first best friend was Morgan, my childhood labrador (he took me for a walk!). I’ve many fond memories of long walks with Morgan around the Derbyshire Dales, before emigrating to Australia, where I grew up with cats, dogs, horses, sheep and even a pet Blue Tongue Lizard! I moved back to the UK in 1995 and adopted a lovely little rescue dog from Battersea, whom I named Charlie. I have not found a job more rewarding than spending my time caring for and walking four-legged friends, hence starting up g'dogmate.
